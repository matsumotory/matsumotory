  <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [â€¦] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>
